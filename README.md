# gama-groupfinder

This is a number of programs to find groups of galaxies from a volume-limited
sample of the GAMA-Survey. The idea was to find groups for different
linking-lengths and to determine if the group distributions indicate a
special linking-length.

## Documentation

## Installation

## Basic features

1. Use Distance_calculator.py to calculate the line-of-sight and transverse
   distances between galaxies for a distinct cosmology.

2. Use galaxypair_finder.py to find galaxy pairs within a given range
   of line-of-sight (in km/s) and transverse (in Mpc) values.

3. Use galaxygroup_finder.py to find galaxy groups from galaxy pairs

4. Use fit_distribution_powerlaw.py to calculate powerlaw-fit and parameters
